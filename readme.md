this is an implementation of neural netorks using different approaches
In the first model i implemented a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers. The perceptron makes better 
prediction with many layers with back propagation. the model had an accuracy 0.94. 
The rest of the models also performed well with the language model not performing that well since it had an
accuracy of 0.87 as compared to the other three models. 

To test the models, make sure you install all the required libraries 
make sure you have python 3.6 installed in your machine 
on a linux machine run python3 autograder.py --check-dependencies to check for dependencies 
if you have installed all the dependencies everything should be working fine. 
have fun with the models
